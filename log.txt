Current:

make Q matrices with every metod on codon_molecular
Why are MG94_F3x4 and MG94_F61 not the same within MolecularEvolution?

Generate Q (with MolecularEvolution.MG94_F3x4) with simulated data...
Cleanup the code to generate a Q 
Compare benjamins Q to my Q matrix
Read up on sample_down! in the script MolecularEvolution.jl/src/core/algorithms/generative.jl 
Reread the idea about partitions.
Make a script to generate loads of different Q
Read up on the other codon models
Try to get my MG94 model working with Benjamins test run
Try to get contrastFEL working
Continue go through that tutorial we had up

Notes:
FUBAR and Contrast-FEL manuscript for details.

How do we convert newick tree to .nex
How do we visualize newick tree (https://github.com/veg/hyphy-analyses/tree/master/LabelTrees)
We need to label the grouped simulated by SimulateMG94 with colour for difFUBAR to identify groups (G1, G2...)
Run example

We can simulate branches stochastically
Contrast-FEL simulation (is this the same as HyPhy simulation)

So the GTRmat can be assigned
The F3x4 parameter is estimated from our data, but we are supposed to simulate the sequences, which is a bit strange? I need to look into this more.

I guess we can assign the F3x4 matrix as well, if not i will get corrected.

check and try to understand sample_down!()
- what is isroot (core/nodes/AbstractTreeNodes.jl)
- what forward! (models/new_model_template.jl)
	Actually forward is in each specific model
	e.g. 
	models/continuous_models/brownian_motion.jl
	models/continuous_models/ornstein_uhlenbeck.jl
	...
	models/compound_models/swm.jl
	etc.
Gaussian Partitions used to integrate data between different nodes.

compound_model/svm.jl - is this completed?

My MG94 code is not exactly the same as Bens. The genetic_code struct from CodonMolecular.jl makes it quite hard to see what is going on.

I am not sure how the Q matrix is build from F3x4 and GTRMat.

What is the issue of comparing Q?
The order of the codons?
genetic_code and attemping to see what is happening?
Is my MG94, the same as using nuc_model(GTPmat) + F3x4 model?

Input the Q matrix in diagonalizedCTMC() and it should work (alt. the generalizedCTMC)
